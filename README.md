Our App is divided Into two main Parts First one is that If SomeOne has no Account then Login Complete first and all the Steps

Thes Two methods are Called the Auth Stack and Second One Is Called the Main Stack :
When The auth stack complete then theses Pages doesnot load again and make the application more and more faster 



We add Some Pages into our auth Stack  and next we will develop them
